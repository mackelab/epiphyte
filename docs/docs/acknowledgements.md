Epiphyte is a tailored implementation of the [DataJoint for Python](https://docs.datajoint.com/core/datajoint-python/latest/) data management framework and was developed at the [Macke Lab](https://www.mackelab.org/) at the University of Tübingen and the [Mormann Lab](https://mormannlab.github.io/) and the University Hospital Bonn.

We thank Fabian Sinz, Edgar Walker, and Christoph-Benjamin Blessing for their DataJoint support, their input on the database setup, general structure, and troubleshooting. Additionally, many thanks to Aleksandar Levic for his work on the data pre-processing pipeline, to Matthijs Pals and Tharanika Thevururasa for establishing the DataJoint infrastructure on Tuebingen's compute cluster, to Sebastian Bischoff for helping troubleshoot the solutions for large-data storage with MinIO, and to Muthu Jeyanthi Prakash for testing the implementation and providing feedback on the GitHub tutorials.
