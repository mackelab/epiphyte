"""
Watch log parsing utilities for extracting PTS and CPU timestamps.

This module provides the :class:`WatchLog` class to read a "watch log" file,
derive start/end times, and build aligned arrays/dataframes of presentation
timestamps (PTS) and real (CPU) times. It also includes helpers to trim the
recorded time series to a maximum movie duration.

Constants:
    MAX_MOVIE_TIME (int): Maximum allowable movie time (in the same units as PTS)
        used to filter out timestamps beyond the movie length.

Example:
    >>> wl = WatchLog("/path/to/watch.log")
    >>> wl.get_start_time(), wl.get_end_time()
    (12, 5012)
    >>> wl.df_pts_cpu.head()
    #    pts  cpu_time
    # 0  0.00      1234
    # 1  0.04      1270

class WatchLog:
    """
    Parse a watch log file and process the concurrent presentation time stamps (PTS) and the local PC (CPU) time series.

    On initialization, this class:
      1) Reads the provided watch log file.
      2) Extracts the start and end CPU timestamps.
      3) Loads all PTS/CPU rows, trims them to the maximum movie length, and
         converts CPU timestamps to seconds (integer, via floor division by 1000).
      4) Builds a pandas DataFrame (:attr:`df_pts_cpu`) with `pts` and `cpu_time`.

    Attributes:
        watch_log_file (str): Absolute or relative path to the watch log file.
        start_time (int): Start time in seconds (CPU time derived from the file).
        end_time (int): End time in seconds (CPU time derived from the file).
        duration (int): Duration in seconds, computed as `end_time - start_time`.
        pts_time_stamps (np.ndarray): Array of PTS values (floats), possibly trimmed.
        dts_time_stamps (np.ndarray): Array of CPU times in seconds (ints), possibly trimmed.
        excluded_indices (list[int]): Indices removed when trimming to `MAX_MOVIE_TIME`.
        df_pts_cpu (pd.DataFrame): Two-column DataFrame with `pts` and `cpu_time`.

    Notes:
        - The method :meth:`getlines` reads the log file in **binary** mode and
          returns a list of byte strings. Downstream parsing assumes whitespace-
          separated fields and converts to numeric types as needed.
        - CPU timestamps are divided by 1000 and cast to `int`, so any sub-second
          resolution is truncated rather than rounded.
